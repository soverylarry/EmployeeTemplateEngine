## Description
This app will build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application 
will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. 
The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This 
assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application 
will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided 
by the user.
